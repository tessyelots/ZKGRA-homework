Repo with homework files for ZKGRA subject.

## Second lab report
File krypto2.js

Input Information: My input is my surname "smutny".

Description of algorithm: Function move() adds K to the character (moves the character by K places in the alphabet. Function caesar() iterates over characters of the input and uses move() funtion to change the place of letters in the alphabet.

Ciphergram: For input "smutny" the output is "lfnmgr".
Execution time for this input was 4.26ms.

## Third Lab report
File krypto3.js

Input Information: 
  My inputs are ciphertexts from first two labs:
    ciphertext1A = "hnfgmb"
    ciphertext1B = "ubstzo"
    ciphertext2 = "lfnmgr"

Description of algorithms: First two decoding algorithms are actually the same as the encoding algorithms. Second decoding algorithm decodeCaesar() is also almost the same as encoding one, but now we are moving the characters by subtracting, not adding the K value. Also there is a function bruteforceCaesar, which can be used if we dont know the K value (shift) of our caesar ciphertext. It just tries all possible K values 0-25.

Output: 
Decoding ciphertext1A by first decoding alg.: smutny
Decoding ciphertext1A by second decoding alg.: gzihbm
Decoding ciphertext1A by caesar decoding, by moving 19 places: oumnti
Decoding ciphertext1B by first decoding alg.: fyhgal
Decoding ciphertext1B by second decoding alg.: smutny
Decoding ciphertext1B by caesar decoding, by moving 19 places: bizagv
Decoding ciphertext2 by first decoding alg.: oumnti
Decoding ciphertext2 by second decoding alg.: cizbhv
Decoding ciphertext2 by caesar decoding, by moving 19 places: smutny

Here in the output of the program we can see that, every decoding algorithm only works for decoding a ciphergram from the same assignment.

Execution time for this was 6.611ms.
